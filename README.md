[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://pokemon-api-app.streamlit.app/)

This project served as an introductory experience to both working with API's and working with streamlit.

The app has the capability to provide information about any of the original pokemon with a slider, including sounds, height and weight.
There is also two interactive charts for comparing pokemon stats that can be built/reset live.
